jUDDI RELEASE NOTES
                          
  Changes From 0.9.0rc1 to 0.9.0rc4

  X. It's been such a long time since 0.9rc1 
     was cut that there are simply way too many 
     changes and improvements to list here.  We 
     believe that virtually all of UDDI v2 is 
     supported at this point.  
     
     Moving foreward, more the jUDDI project will
     be releasing much more often and will include
     careful tracking and reporting of changes and 
     features will begin with the 0.9rc4 release.

     If you would like to see a complete list of 
     fixes and feature requests that have been 
     addressed since jUDDI moved to the Apache
     Web Services Project visit the issue 
     tracker which can be found at the following URL:
     
     http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10401
     
  Changes From 0.8.0 to 0.9.0rc1

  1. Added CategoryBag support to BindingTemplate
     per UDDI v3 specification.

  2. Addressed bug# 784297 by replacing use of JDBC
     Statement with PreparedStatement so that all
     SQL values are escaped by the JDBC driver.

  3. Table creation scripts (DDL) have been added
     for PostgreSQL DBMS. Contributed by Glenn
     Bullock. (http://www.postgresql.org)

  4. Table creation scripts (DDL) have been added
     for the TotalXML XML Database. Contributed by
     B. Subrahmanya Nayak (http://www.totalxml.net/)

  5. Fixed bug# 796725, discarded authTokens
     can be used to update the registry. A new
     query is added to AuthTokenTable.java;
     JDBCDataStore.java calls this query to
     validate the authToken's state.

  6. Replaced jUDDI's internal ConnectionPooling
     with Jakarta Commons DBCP package. This type
     of connection pooling is useful when using
     the jUDDI WebApp (or simply the RegistryEngine)
     in an environment where JNDI is not available.
  
  7. Moved Anou's encryption code into a new 
     org.apache.juddi.cryptor package (from the
     org.apache.juddi.auth.crypt package) so that
     the functionality could be used elsewhere.
     
  8. Eliminated the need to subclass AuthenticatorFactory
     and moved all Authenticator implementations 
     up into the org.apache.juddi.auth package.
     
  9. Renamed SimpleAuthenticator to DefaultAuthenticator
     to coincide with the "DefaultXxxx" naming 
     convention used in other packages.
     
 10. Renamed the default UUIDGen implementation 
     from org.apache.juddi.uuidgen.QuickUUIDGen to 
     DefaultUUIDGen (it remains in the same package).
    
 11. Renamed the org.apache.juddi.client package to 
     org.apache.juddi.proxy.
     
 12. Eliminated the unimplemented org.apache.juddi.monitor.http
     package.
     
 13. Removed unimplemented links to jUDDI Admin 
     and Browser from the jUDDI home page (index.html).
     
 14. More bug fixes: http://ws.apache.org/juddi/bugs.html
   
 15. Eliminated the need to subclass DataStoreFactory. Only
     required to subclass DataStore. Updated JDBCDataStore and
     removed the now-unneccessary JDBCDataStoreFactory.
     
 16. Calls to the delete_tModel function no longer remove
     the TModel from the TMODEL table, it is now simply 
     marked as removed (see bug# 11) per the UDDI 
     specification(s).
     
 17. Updated underlying Axis implementation to ver 1.2 beta.
 
 18. Added a JBossAuthenticator donated by Antoni Reus
 
 19. HTTP GET requests to the three jUDDI endpoints (inquiry,
     publish and admin) now return HTTP 405 Method Not 
     Allowed error messages according to the HTTP 1.1 
     specification. (see bug# JUDDI-23 for more info)
 
 20. Added functionality to support retreival of 
     UDDI artifacts (business entity, business 
     service, binding template and/or tmodel) via
     http with calls to:
     
      http://host:port/juddi/uddiget.jsp?businesskey=
      http://host:port/juddi/uddiget.jsp?servicekey=
      http://host:port/juddi/uddiget.jsp?bindingkey=
      http://host:port/juddi/uddiget.jsp?tmodelkey=    

  Changes From 0.7.2 to 0.8.0

  1. The version of Axis included with jUDDI is now
     Axis 1.1 Final. The 'log4j.properties' file
     that is bundled within axis.jar has been removed
     to avoid conflicts with the log4j.properties
     file in jUDDI's WEB-INF/classes directory.

  2. Log4j is now accessed through Jakarta's
     commons-logging package.

  3. &lt;env-entry&gt; values for juddi.propsFile
     and log4j.propsFile are no longer requred.
     Instead the juddi.properties and
     log4j.properties files are looked up in
     the classpath.

     This means that for the jUDDI webapp these
     files should be located in the WEB-INF/lib
     directory (they are copied from juddi/conf
     into this directory the build process).

  4. A jUDDI client has been added bringing
     jUDDI full-circle back to being a UDDI
     toolkit (beginnings of one). Take a look
     at org.apache.juddi.registry.RegistryProxy
     and also take a look at the contents of
     the juddi/samples directory.

  5. The beginnings of an admin API has been
     introduced with the addition of four
     jUDDI-proprietary API calls (which are
     still under construction).

         save_publisher
         get_publisherDetail
         delete_publisher
         find_publisher

     This introduced several new classes:

       org.apache.juddidatatype.request.SavePublisher
       org.apache.juddidatatype.request.GetPublisherDetail
       org.apache.juddidatatype.request.DeletePublisher
       org.apache.juddidatatype.request.FindPublisher
       org.apache.juddidatatype.publisher.PublisherID
       org.apache.juddidatatype.response.PublisherList
       org.apache.juddidatatype.response.PublisherDetail
       org.apache.juddidatatype.response.PublisherInfo
       org.apache.juddidatatype.response.PublisherInfos

	Handlers for each of the classes above have
	also been created in the org.apache.juddihandlers
	package.


  6. Added support for the 'generic' attribute
     to the UDDI Response messages (this was
     being handled in the AxixRequestHandler).
     Also updated all associated Handler
     classes to marshal/unmarshal this value.

  7. The org.apache.juddiregistry.functions package
     was moved/renamted to org.apache.juddifunctions.

  8. (bug-fix) Added a default constructor to
     org.apache.juddidatatype.response.PublisherAssertions

  9. (bug-fix) Added support for mashalling &
     unmarshalling the 'operator' value to
     org.apache.juddihandler.PublisherAssertionsHandler.

 10. Expanded the PUBLISHER table to support the
     new jUDDI Admin API

     *** THIS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE AS ANY EXISTING
     jUDDI IMPLEMENTATION WILL NEED TO MAKE THIS
     CHANGE BEFORE USING THE MOST MOST RECENT JUDDI
     SOURCE!!!

     The 0.7.0 and 0.7.1 PUBLISHER table:

	  CREATE TABLE PUBLISHER
	  (
	    PUBLISHER_ID VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	    PUBLISHER_NAME VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	    ADMIN VARCHAR(5) NULL,
	    PRIMARY KEY (PUBLISHER_ID)
	  );

     The new PUBLISHER table:
     (from ddl/juddi_mysql.ddl)

	  CREATE TABLE PUBLISHER
	  (
	    PUBLISHER_ID VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	    PUBLISHER_NAME VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	    LAST_NAME VARCHAR(150) NULL,
	    FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(100) NULL,
	    MIDDLE_INIT VARCHAR(5) NULL,
	    WORK_PHONE VARCHAR(50) NULL,
	    MOBILE_PHONE VARCHAR(50) NULL,
	    PAGER VARCHAR(50) NULL,
	    EMAIL_ADDRESS VARCHAR(255) NULL,
	    ADMIN VARCHAR(5) NULL,
	    ENABLED VARCHAR(5) NULL,
	    PRIMARY KEY (PUBLISHER_ID)
	  );

 11. The following two methods have been removed
     from the abstract 'Handler' class and all
     subclasses (lots of them) and any imports
     that were required by these methods.

      RegistryObject unmarshal(SOAPElement e)
      void marshal(RegistryObject o,SOAPElement e)

     These were never completely implemented
     or used by jUDDI.

 12. Added new 'test' and 'checkstyle' Ant
     tasks.

 13. The happyjuddi.jsp page has been updated
     with several great new 'debugging' features.

 14. When specifying a JNDI name for a JDBC
     DataSource in jUDDI's juddi.properties file
     you must now use a fully qualified name.

      Old way (0.7.2 and earlier):

        juddi.dataSource=jdbc/juddiDB

      New way: (0.8.0 and later):

        juddi.dataSource=java:comp/env/jdbc/juddiDB

 15. Both getGeneric() and setGeneric() methods were
     added to the following list of classes in the
     org.apache.juddidatatype.response package:

	  AssertionStatusReport
	  AuthToken
	  BindingDetail
	  BusinessDetail
	  BusinessDetailExt
	  BusinessList
	  PublisherAssertions
	  RegisteredInfo
	  RelatedBusinessList
	  ServiceDetail
	  ServiceList
	  TModelDetail
	  TModelList

	 The following handler classes from the
	 the org.apache.juddihandler package were updated
	 to marshal/unmarshal the new generic value.

	  AssertionStatusReportHandler
	  AuthTokenHandler
	  BindingDetailHandler
	  BusinessDetailHandler
	  BusinessDetailExtHandler
	  BusinessListHandler
	  PublisherAssertionsHandler
	  RegisteredInfoHandler
	  RelatedBusinessListHandler
	  ServiceDetailHandler
	  ServiceListHandler
	  TModelDetailHandler
	  TModelListHandler

   This value was being set in the AxisProcessor
   (in org.apache.judditransport.axis). All associated
   unit test methods within the XxxxHandler classes
   were updated as well.
