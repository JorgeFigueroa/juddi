This example is a command line demonstration of how to interact with JUDDI.

1. Download Apache Ivy and update the project.properties

2. Check the settings of the META-INF/uddi.xml, to make sure the serverName and serverPort are set correctly.

3. ant run

  run:
     [echo] HelloWorld Grab AuthToken
     [java] log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.commons.configuration.ConfigurationUtils).
     [java] log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
     [java] AUTHTOKEN = authtoken:8f18d677-b19d-454f-b1ba-61bc5947c16e
  
  
  
For further examples, see the uddi-client module, which includes a number
of unit tests that exercise API other than just the security API.
