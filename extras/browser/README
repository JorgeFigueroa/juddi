                     0.8
  

  What is it?
  -----------

  The jUDDI Web GUI is a simplified Web based graphical user interface to a UDDI
  service repository making use of the general UDDI API via Web Services calls. 
  The GUI is implemented based on Cocoon.
  
  The limitations of the provided GUI is that login and password of the UDDI must
  be the standard values of a jUDDI repository, that is "juddi". Further, the 
  number of input fields of the Business Entity, Business Service, and tModel has 
  been limited as much as possible. Finally, the assignment of WSDL documents to 
  a Business Service is treated slightly different to the specification by adding
  it as a tModel to the categoryBag of the service.



  Requirements
  ------------

  The jUDDI Web GUI is based on Apache Cocoon (http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/), 
  thus, requires a complete Cocoon instalation. No further requirements exist.
