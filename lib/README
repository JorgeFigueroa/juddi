The Java libraries found in this directory are used during 
the build or unit testing process only and are not deployed 
with the jUDDI web application.

A jar file containing the servlet API classes is required 
to successfully build jUDDI.  This is available from a 
number of places including Tomcat:

	Jakarta Tomcat (http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat)
	-------------------------------------------------
	servlet.jar

If you're plannign to run the	JUnit test cases that accompany
jUDDI you'll need a copy of the JUnit jar file to be placed
in this directory:

 (http://www.junit.org)
	---------------------
	junit.jar

If you're building with a JRE that preceeds 1.4 you'll need the 
following jar files:

	Java Cryptography Extensions (http://java.sun.com/products/jce/)
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	jce.jar
	
	Jakarta Tomcat (http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat)
	-------------------------------------------------
	jdbc2_0-stdext.jar
		
Finally, the JBossAuthenticator is opptionally built and 
included in the juddi.jar file if the dependent JBoss classes 
are available in the classpath.if you're planning to use the 
JBossAuthenticator you'll need a copy of the jboss.jar file.  

	JBoss (http://www.jboss.org)
	----------------------------
	jdbc2_0-stdext.jar
	servlet.jar
