      <title>Updating the Site jUDDI Web Site</title>
      <p>You'll need the appropriate version of <link href="http://xml.apache.org/forrest/">forrest</link> as
	well as the appropriate version of <link href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant</link>. This document
	assumes you generally understand how to use these tools. 
      </p>
      <p>
       The site source is located under our source tree at ws-juddi/site. To build the site, simply invoke 
	forrest in ws-juddi/site. The built sources will be located at ws-juddi/build/site. You should 
	get a clean build, and no broken links. There aren't any known issues with the site. 
	</p>
	<p>
	You must test your builds locally by running forrest on your local box. You can do this by invoking 
	'forrest run' in ws-juddi/site.
	</p>
	<p>
	The commit process is a bit complicated.
	The live site is hosted under the ws-site source tree, -not- the ws-juddi src tree. The ws-juddi/build/site
	directory hierarchy maps to the ws-site/targets/juddi directory hierarchy. 
	Once you've built the site copy the latter hierarchy to the former, and then commit the 
	changes. The live site is updated about every 6 hours from cvs.
	</p>
	<p>
	You must -also- commit the changes you've made under ws-juddi/site to persist the changes for the next
	committer to be able to reproduce your modifications. 
	</p>
	<p>
	To fully clean any site build you've created, you can safely delete everything under ws-juddi/site/build.
