      <title>About UDDI</title>

        <p>UDDI stands for Universal Description, Discovery and Integration. The
          UDDI specification enables businesses to quickly, easily, and dynamically
          find and transact with one another. UDDI enables a business to (i) describe
          its business and its services, (ii) discover other businesses that offer
          desired services, and (iii) integrate with these other businesses. UDDI
          enables companies to publish how they want to conduct business on the
          web, potentially fueling growth of Web services-based electronic commerce.</p>

        <p>UDDI benefits businesses of all sizes by creating a global, platform-independent,
          open architecture for describing businesses and services, discovering
          those businesses and services, and integrating businesses using the
          Internet.</p>

        <p>The UDDI project is a sweeping industry initiative. The project creates
          a platform-independent, open framework for describing services, discovering
          businesses, and integrating business services using the Internet, as
          well as an operational registry that is available today.</p>

        <p>UDDI is the first truly cross-industry effort driven by all major platform
          and software providers, as well as marketplace operators and e-business
          leaders. These technology and business pioneers are acting as the initial
          catalysts to quickly develop UDDI and related technologies.</p>

        <p>The UDDI project takes advantage of WorldWide Web Consortium (W3C)
          and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards such as Extensible
          Markup Language (XML), and HTTP and Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
          Additionally, cross platform programming features are addressed by adopting
          early versions of the proposed Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
          known as XML Protocol messaging specifications found at the W3C Web
          site. The UDDI protocol is the building block that will enable businesses
          to quickly, easily and dynamically find and transact with one another
          using their preferred applications.</p>

   <section><title>Disclaimer</title>
      <p>
      jUDDIis an incubated subproject under the sponsorship of the
      Apache Software Foundation's (ASF) Web Services
      project. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
      until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
      communications, and decision making process have stabilized in
      a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
      incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
      completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that
      the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
