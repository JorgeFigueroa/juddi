      <p>Every volunteer project obtains its strength from the people involved in it.
        We invite you to participate as much or as little as you choose. The roles
        and responsibilities that people can assume in the project are based on
        merit. Everybody's input matters!
      </p>
      <p>There are a variety of ways to participate. Regardless of how you choose
        to participate, we suggest you join some or all of our <link href="lists.html">mailing lists</link>.
      </p>

        <title>Use the Products &amp; Give Us Feedback</title>
        <p>Using the products,reporting bugs, making feature requests, etc. is by
          far the most important role. It's your feedback that allows the technology
          to evolve.

        <title>Contribute Code or Documentation Patches</title>
        <p>In this role, you participate in the actual development of the code. If this
          is the type of role you'd like to play, here are some steps (in addition to
          the ones above) to get you started:
          <ul>
            <li> <link href="lists.html#guidelines">Read Mailing List Guidelines </link></li>
            <li> <link href="library.html">Review Reference Library </link></li>
            <li> <link href="releases.html">Download the Source Code</link></li>
            <li> <link href="cvs.html">Access CVS Repository </link></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Any and all new development or bug fixing uses the latest code base.
          If you have a patch, it should be submitted against the latest available
          code.
        </p>

      <section>
        <title>Getting Support on the Lists</title>
        <p>We do all development and bug fixing on the latest available code base.
          If you've encountered what you think is a bug, please first check the
          <link href="bugs.html">bug database</link> for known issues. If you
          can't find your bug, make sure you're using the latest code base. We are
          not able to fix bugs on earlier code bases.
        </p>
        <p>Please include any relevant version information and the error message
            text, if there is one. If you have a problem with a specific interface,
            like find_business, you'll likely be asked to post a log of the SOAP
            message exchanges between your client and the jUDDI server. You can
            use the axis tool
            <link href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/developers-guide.html">TCPMon</link>
            to capture these messages.
        </p>
        <p>Remember, Apache helps those that help themselves. Please take a look
          at Eric S. Raymond's and Rick Moen's explanation of
          <link href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">"How to Ask Questions The Smart Way</link>.

        <title>jUDDI Wiki</title>
        <p>Like other Apache projects, jUDDI maintains a wiki, a sort of virtual
          meeting place for the jUDDI community. This is a resource available
          to everyone, and you are encouraged to contribute. This is a good resource
          for 'HowTos' for common configuration issues.
