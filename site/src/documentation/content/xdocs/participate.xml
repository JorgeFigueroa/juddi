      <p>Every volunteer project obtains its strength from the people involved in it. 
        We invite you to participate as much or as little as you choose. The roles 
        and responsibilities that people can assume in the project are based on 
        merit. Everybody's input matters!
      </p>
      <p>There are a variety of ways to participate. Regardless of how you choose 
        to participate, we suggest you join some or all of our <link href="lists.html">mailing lists</link>.
