        <!-- INSTRUCTIONS FOR DISTRIBUTING A jUDDI RELEASE
        
             NON-FINAL RELEASES
             
               You'll need to deploy releases that don't need to be mirrored 
               to archive.apache.org and place your files in a new directory
               named after the version of your release (i.e. 0_9rc1 for version
               0.9rc1) within the following directory: 
                
                 /www/archive.apache.org/dist/ws/juddi 
          
               So the files for jUDDI 0.9rc1 would end up here:
             
                 /www/archive.apache.org/dist/ws/juddi/0_9rc1
                      
               FINAL RELEASES
             
                 (to-do)
             
        -->
        
        <!--
        <tr>
          <td><link href="http://ws.apache.org/juddi/download.cgi">0.9</link> (from mirror)</td>
          <td>July 1, 2004</td>
          <td>Final Version 0.9</td>
        </tr>
        -->

        <tr>
          <td><link href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/ws/juddi/0_9rc1/">0.9rc1</link></td>
          <td>June 12, 2004</td>
          <td>Release Candidate 1 for Version 0.9</td>
        </tr>
