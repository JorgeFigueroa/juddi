      <title>Who We Are</title>
      <p>
        The jUDDI Project operates on a meritocracy: the more you do,
        the more responsibility you will obtain. This page lists all
        of the people who have gone the extra mile and are
        Committers. If you would like to get involved, the first step
        is to join the mailing lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking
        for support. We are non-paid volunteers who help out with the
        project and we do not necessarily have the time or energy to
        help people on an individual basis. Instead, we have setup
        mailing lists which often contain hundreds of individuals who
        will help answer detailed requests for help. The benefit of
        using mailing lists over private communication is that it is
        a shared resource where others can also learn from common
        mistakes and as a community we all grow together.
