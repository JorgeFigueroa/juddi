#    Translation instructions.
#
# 1. Each message line is of the form key=value. Translate 
#    the value, DO NOT translate the key.
#
# 2. The messages may contain arguments that will be filled 
#    in by the runtime. These are of the form: {0}, {1}, etc.
#    These must appear as is in the message, though the order
#    may be changed to support proper language syntax.
#
# 3. If a single quote character is to appear in the resulting
#    message, it must appear in this file as two consecutive
#    single quote characters.
#
# 4. Lines beginning with "#" (like this one) are comment 
#    lines and may contain translation instructions.  They 
#    need not be translated unless your translated file, 
#    rather than this file, will serve as a base for other 
#    translators.
