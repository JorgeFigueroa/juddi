      <section name="About UDDI">
        <p>The Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) protocol is 
          one of the major building blocks required for successful Web services. 
          UDDI creates a standard interoperable platform that enables companies 
          and applications to quickly, easily, and dynamically find and use Web 
          services over the Internet. UDDI also allows operational registries to 
          be maintained for different purposes in different contexts. UDDI is a 
          cross-industry effort driven by major platform and software providers, 
          as well as marketplace operators and e-business leaders within the 
          OASIS standards consortium.
        </p>
        <p>Additional information regarding UDDI can be found 
          at <a href="http://www.uddi.org/">UDDI.org</a>.
