The Java libraries found in this directory are deployed with the 
jUDDI web application. If you're building jUDDI from source you 
will need to acquire the two jar files below and place them in 
this directory.

	Java API for XML-Based RPC (http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxrpc/)
	--------------------------
	jax-rpc.jar
	
	SOAP with Attachments API for Java (http://java.sun.com/xml/saaj/)
	----------------------------------
	saaj.jar

If you're having trouble finding them I'd suggest grabbing them
from the Axis 1.2 final distribution.  This is where the other 
jar files in this directory were taken.  For licensing reasons
we could not make them available from the jUDDI CVS repository.
