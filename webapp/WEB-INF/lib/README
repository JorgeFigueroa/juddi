The Java libraries found in this directory are deployed with the 
jUDDI web application. If you're building jUDDI from source you 
will need to acquire the two jar files below and place them in 
this directory.

	Java API for XML-Based RPC (http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxrpc/)
	--------------------------
	jax-rpc.jar
	
	SOAP with Attachments API for Java (http://java.sun.com/xml/saaj/)
	----------------------------------
	saaj.jar

NOTE: This jUDDI release includes a slightly modified 
version of Apache Axis 1.2rc2 (axis.jar) and the jar 
files that ship with Axis.  A change which jUDDI requires 
was to the org.apache.axis.message.MessageElement class after
the 1.2rc2 release was packaged so I've included that change
here.
